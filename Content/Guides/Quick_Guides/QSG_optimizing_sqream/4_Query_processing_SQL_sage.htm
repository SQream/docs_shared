        <h2>Query Processing and SQL Usage</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Joins: To take advantage of GPU utilization, consider writing the queries in a way that allows reducing the fact tables before the join operation.
				<p class="example">Example</p><p class="code">Example query: 
					select  store_name, sum(amount) 
					from dimention dim join fact on dim.store_id=fact.store_id 
					where p_date between '2018-07-01' and '2018-07-31'
					group by  store_name;
					</p><p class="code"><span class="strong">Recommended query syntax to reduce fact table:</span> 
					select store_name, sum_amount
					from dimention as dim inner join
					(select sum(amount) as sum_amount, store_id
					from fact
					where p_date between '2018-07-01' and '2018-07-31'
					group by store_id
					) as fact
					on dim.store_id=fact.store_id;
				</p></li>
            <li>Use high selectivity hint when filtering out most of the table on a non-sorted column. See
			</li>
            <li>
				Due to the metadata that SQream keeps on the existing data, SQream can often do data skipping and and eliminate wasted IO/GPU time.
				<p>For better data skipping, increase the use of sargable conditions to do as much filtering as possible in the WHERE clause: (=,&gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, BETWEEN, LIKE, IS [NOT] NULL, EXISTS, IN).
				</p></li>
            <li>Whenever possible, use '<span class="codeCH">select count(*)</span>' rather than '<span class="codeCH">select count(column_name)</span>'
				<p><span class="codeCH">count(*)</span> allows SQream to read the metadata and to avoid unecessary calculations.
				</p><p>Please note that in SQream the metadata is always up-to-date and there is no need to gather statistics.
 			       </p><p class="example">Example</p><p class="code">&gt; select count(*) from big;
				85598208
				1 row
				time: 0.065940s				</p></li>
            <li>Query only the columns you need (unlike <span class="codeCH">select * from</span>).
				<p>Since SQream is a columnar database, it will load all the columns in the statement.</p><p class="example">Example</p><p class="code">Assuming the table has 20 columns and you need only 4:
				Select col1, col2, col10 from my_table
				where col7='my_predicate';
				</p></li>
            <li>Fetch time can be expensive. If many uneeded rows  are likely to be returned, add '<span class="codeCH">TOP N</span>' to the query.
				<div class="note"><span class="codeCH">TOP N</span> is applied only at the fetch time, after the full run is finished. It does not affect run time.</div><p class="example">Example</p><p class="code">Select top 100 col1, col2, col10 
					from my_table
					where col7='my_predicate';
				</p></li>
            <li>Functions on integers return a rounded integer.
				<p>For mathematical operations on integers, use either use <span class="codeCH">CAST TO FLOAT</span> or a decimal number.</p><p class="example">Example</p><p class="code">Calculate how much is 77% out of 500:
					from my_table
					where col7='my_predicate';
				</p></li>
            <li>
                <p>For large queries (multiple joins etc), consider using saved queries to save compilation time. Note that saved queries can use variables. See</p>
