        <h3>Subscribing And Unsubscribing Services</h3>
        <p>There are 2 methods for subscribing or unsubscribing a service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Initial configuration: insert or delete the service name in the initial configuration file. The service will be subscribed or unsubscribed only after a system restart.</li>
            <li>Online: use the appropriate utility function to subscribe or unsubscribe a service while the system is running. The change takes place immediately for the current session.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since the utility function affects only the current session, you must also edit the initial configuration in order to permanently modify the service subscription status.</p>
        <p class="note">If no service name is specified in any command, the default 'sqream' service is assumed.</p>
