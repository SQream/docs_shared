        <h2>Overview
</h2>
        <p>Each SQream instance has its own hardware resources (GPU, RAM etc.) as defined in its parameters setting. SQream distributes work among its instances in such a way as to maximize hardware utilization. By default, this distribution is done in an equal manner.
</p>
        <p>You can change this setting and optimize hardware utilization by using SQream Dynamic Workload Manager and subscribing each SQream instance to specific service/s, and connecting different sessions to these services.
